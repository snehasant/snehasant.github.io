I am an immunologist based at <a href=https://www.petermac.org/research/labs/sherene-loi>Loi Lab</a> of Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre where I work with <a href=https://www.petermac.org/users/prof-sherene-loi>Prof. Sherene Loi</a> on understanding the immune cell response in breast cancer patients.

Prior to this role, I earned my Ph.D. at the Doherty Institute, University of Melbourne for my work on the role of T cells in influenza infection under the supervision of <a href=https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/professor-katherine-kedzierska>Prof. Katherine Kedzierska</a>, <a href=https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/dr-liyen-loh>Liyen Loh</a> and the mentorship of <a href=https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/laureate-professor-peter-doherty>Nobel Laureate Prof. Peter C Doherty</a>.

I have spent 3 glorious years working at the National AIDS Research Insititute, India where I broadened my horizons of immunology. I hold a Master of Science (Hons) and Bachelor of Science (Hons) in biotechnology from the University of Pune.
